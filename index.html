	<p>
		Amp is a non-blocking concurrency framework for PHP applications.
	</p>

	<h2 id="non-blocking-io">What is asynchronous non-blocking I/O?</h2>

	<p>
		Usually, at least in the PHP world, everything happens synchronously in your code. When you make a
		database query, you call a function. That function sends the query to the server, then it waits (or
		"blocks") until it gets a response and returns the retrieved value.
	</p>

	<p>
		We can do better than that. With non-blocking I/O we can perform other tasks while waiting for the
		database server to return a result. We could fire off a second query in the meantime or perform any
		other task.
	</p>

	<p>
		You might respond "What's so bad about waiting? The kernel will just schedule other tasks during that
		waiting time?" While that is true, and it's how most applications work today, it's not the end of the
		story.
	</p>

	<p>
		Let's make a comparison with cooking a soup. With blocking I/O, you first have to peel the
		potatos and other vegetables and then slice them (CPU work). Once you're finished, you can turn on the
		stove. Now you're waiting for the water in the pot to become hot. It's hot now, so you can put all
		vegetables into the pot and wait for it to be done.
	</p>

	<p>
		With non-blocking I/O, you could have turned on your stove directly. You could delegate the actual hard
		work of slicing the vegetables to workers (your children). While being in idle waiting for the stove
		and the workers, you could stream a video from YouTube and watch it. Once everything is ready, you can
		put it into the pot. While you're waiting for it to be done, you can play a game with your children.
	</p>

	<p>
		But how does it work in reality? All I/O is managed by the kernel. We just write to the kernel's buffer,
		we don't wait until the data is actually sent to the other side. In the mean time, we can do other
		things. Once we can an answer, the kernel will notify us that there's a new readable event.
	</p>

	<p>
		This waiting time isn't limited to databases, it's more and more important as you add I/O to your
		application, e.g. by using microservices. Non-blocking I/O makes more efficient use of your processes,
		because you know, processes cost memory and need to be scheduled.
	</p>

	<h2 id="hello-world">Hello World</h2>

	<p>
		Let's see how it would actually look like in code. We don't use I/O in this hello world, instead we use
		another type of event - timers. Just click <i>"Run"</i> to see what happens.
	</p>

	<p>
		We emulate this simple example in javascript, but if you want to see it live on your local machine with PHP,
		just clone our <a href="https://github.com/amphp/hello-world"><code>hello-world</code></a> repository and run
		<code>php timer.php</code>.
	</p>

	<pre><code class="language-php">&lt;?php

function tick() {
    echo "tick\n";
}

echo "before run()\n";

Amp\run(function() {
    Amp\repeat("tick", $msInterval = 1000);
    Amp\once("Amp\stop", $msDelay = 5000);
});

echo "after run()\n";</code></pre>

	<p class="text-right">
		<button class="btn btn-green" id="run"><i class="fa fa-play"></i> Run code sample</button>
	</p>

	<pre id="run-output"></pre>

	<script>
		var button = document.getElementById("run");
		var output = document.getElementById("run-output");
		var run = false;

		button.addEventListener("click", function(e) {
			output.textContent = "before run()\n";
			button.disabled = true;

			run = setInterval(tick, 1000);
			setTimeout(stop, 5000);
		});

		function tick() {
			output.textContent += "tick\n";
		}

		function stop() {
			output.textContent += "after run()\n";
			button.disabled = false;

			clearInterval(run);
		}
	</script>

	<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>

	<p>
		We already have a good set of libraries and packages you can use. Not all of them have a documentation
		yet, <a href="https://github.com/amphp/amphp.github.io">you're welcome to help</a>. You can install all
		our libraries using <a href="https://getcomposer.org">Composer</a>. Just have a look at the blue top
		menu listing the packages. It's indicated whether they have documentation here already or not through
		the icon on the right.
	</p>

	<pre><code class="language-bash" id="install">composer require amphp/amp</code></pre>

	<script>
		var install = document.getElementById("install");

		var packages = [
			{% for repository in site.github.public_repositories %}
				{% if repository.name != "amphp.github.io" and repository.name != "template" and repository.name != "design" and repository.name != "hello-world" %}
					{{repository.name | jsonify}},
				{% endif %}
			{% endfor %}
			"amp"
		];

		setInterval(function() {
			install.textContent = "composer require amphp/" + packages[parseInt(Math.floor(Math.random() * packages.length))];
		}, 2000);
